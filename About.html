        <h2 class="section-header">ABOUT</h2>
        <h3 class="center">Patagon was founded by singer Anders Str√∏m and guitarist Jarl Roe, 13 years after they first
            began their musical relationship within the heavy genre.
            <br>
            <br>
             Over the past years Anders had spent much time on gigging
            his way through the Norwegian land, playing acoustic solo endeavors and other projects with various artists in
            the nordics; and Jarl found his joy back for creating with the guitar through his solo-guitar EP release four seasons.
            <br>
            <br>
            After feeling a strong yearning to return to the heavy scene as one and express their emotions, they went in to the studio
            to see if the magic in creating music with each other was still there. They felt super excited to be back
            and recorded the two song single "fade" as their debut.
            <br>
            <br>
            Patagon is currently recording their debut full lenght album, for release in 2021!
